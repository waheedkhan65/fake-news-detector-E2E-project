# fake-news-detector-E2E-project
Absolutely, Waheed! Here’s a clean, professional `README.md` tailored to your **Fake News Detection E2E ML project** using Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit, and a real dataset (fake/true news). This is production-quality — you can copy it as-is into your repo root.

# 📰 Fake News Detection ML Project

An end-to-end machine learning application that detects whether a given news article is **FAKE** or **REAL** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and deployed with Streamlit for interactive use.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data ingestion from two separate CSV files: `fake.csv` and `true.csv`
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (TF-IDF vectorization)
- Binary classification using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix)
- Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions
- Modular, production-ready codebase

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle – Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
* `fake.csv`: News articles labeled as fake
* `true.csv`: News articles labeled as real
* Each row contains `title`, `text`, `subject`, and `date`

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detector-E2E-project.git
cd fake-news-detector-E2E-project

# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. `preprocess.py`: Loads and merges real and fake news, assigns labels.
2. `train_model.py`: Builds a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression pipeline, evaluates it, and saves `model.pkl`.
3. `streamlit_app.py`: Loads the saved model and lets the user input a news article to classify in real time.

---

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
# Train the model (only once or after data changes)
python src/train_model.py

# Launch the Streamlit app
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

---

## 📈 Model Performance (Sample Output)

```
Accuracy: 98.27%

Precision: 0.99 (Fake), 0.98 (Real)
Recall:    0.98 (Fake), 0.99 (Real)
F1-Score:  0.98 overall
---

## ✅ To-Do (Future Enhancements)

* [ ] Add LSTM or BERT model for comparison
* [ ] Save prediction logs for audit trail
* [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
* [ ] Add UI dropdown to test with sample fake/real articles
